# üß© Unified Prompt ‚Äî GitFlow CI/CD Modernization (Jenkins + OCP + Nexus)

We want to design and implement a **strict GitFlow-based CI/CD pipeline** for our workloads using **Jenkins Shared Libraries**, aligned with industry best practices and minimizing developer cognitive overhead through automation.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Vision & Workflow Narrative (confirm/expand)

We will enforce **GitFlow branching discipline** with automated CI/CD for every branch type.

* Developers branch from `develop` to create `feature/*`.
  Each commit triggers a CI pipeline that:

  1. Builds and tests code
  2. Runs NexusIQ and Aqua scans
  3. Pushes the image to Nexus Docker registry
  4. Deploys to **CAB**
  5. Runs smoke/BDD tests
  6. Reports back via GitHub status checks

* Once merged into `develop`, a **develop-CI/CD** pipeline:

  1. Builds and deploys to **DEV**
  2. Runs service-level BDD (rollback on failure)
  3. Deploys to **CDTEST**
  4. Runs scheduled + on-demand E2E functional tests
  5. Promotes successful images to **SIT2** for E2E integration

* **Release branches** are created from `develop`, deployed through:

  1. SIT1 (manual regression tests)
  2. PREPROD (non-functional tests)
  3. PROD (via ServiceNow approval)
     After successful release, the branch merges into `main` and `develop`.

* **Hotfixes** follow the same flow as releases but originate from `main`.
